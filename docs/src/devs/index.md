## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or opinions on how things can be improved, don’t hesitate to let us know by posting an issue on GitHub or @ing me on the Riot API Discord channel. We always want to hear from our users, even (especially) if it’s just letting us know how you are using Pyot.

As a user you get to ignore the small details and just use the features of Pyot. But as a developer you get to dive into the nitty-gritty and pick apart the implementation that makes everything work. If you don’t want to dive too deep, you can likely contribute even without knowing all the details. You can find opportunities to help by looking at our issues.

## Plugins

Pyot is made to be very flexible and monkey patchable. Developers can freely build Plugins for Pyot (e.g. SQL cache store). Please DM me or open an issue if you want to add your plugin to this documentation.

Take advantage of all the low level API from pyot as well as the base classes for the objects.

## Wanted Features

1. VALORANT static assets API Objects (?).
2. Dynamic caching based on object content, e.g. if match is older than x, then cache for less/more time.
3. LCU API.
4. Ingame API.
