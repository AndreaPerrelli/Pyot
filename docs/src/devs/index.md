# Developing around Pyot

Developing around Pyot is nice and helps our community !

## Plugins

Pyot is made to be very flexible and mokey patchable. Developers can freely build Plugins for Pyot (e.g. the so wanted SQL cache store). Please DM me or open an issue if you want to add your plugin to this documentation.

Take advantage of all the low level API from pyot, and also the base classes for the objects.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have idea or opinions on how things can be improved, don’t hesitate to let us know by posting an issue on GitHub or @ing me on the Riot API Discord channel. And we always want to hear from our users, even (especially) if it’s just letting us know how you are using Pyot.

As a user you get to ignore the details and just use the features of Pyot. But as a developer you get to dive into the nitty-gritty and pick apart the implementation that makes everything work. If you don’t want to dive too deep, you can likely contribute even without knowing all the details. and you can find opportunities to help by looking at our issues.

> Yes, I copy pasted these words but it's also exactly what I truly want to transmit.

## Wanted Features

1. Valorant static assets API Objects (?).
2. Possible LoR API objects if announced, with all the static assets provided.
3. An attempt to introduce SQL db for pyot projects (only a PR for a store that can be ported to all big databases is accepted, otherwise please submit as a Plugin).
